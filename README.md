# AC_Remote
A custom AC remote using an ESP32 and PlatformIO.

Targets:
* Duct tape the "remote" to my AC
* Control the remote with a website or a Discord bot
* The AC should automatically turn off at a specific time (So my neighbors don't write angry lettes anymore)
* Automatic turn on / off depending on the temperature
